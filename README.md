Smart Garden Project Motivation

Imagine that you are a busy professional who enjoys gardening but finds it challenging to find the time to give your plants the care they require. You have a variety of plants in your garden, including veggies, herbs, and flowers, and you want to ensure that they are all getting enough water and thriving in the best conditions possible.

You can use your smart garden system to install sensors that monitor the moisture and temperature levels in your garden. These sensors can be linked to an Arduino Uno WiFi Rev 2, which feeds data to a Raspberry Pi 3 that serves as a MQTT broker. The data from the sensors can be used to regulate your water pump, which is also connected to the Raspberry Pi. If the moisture level is too low, for example, the pump can be activated to water the plants.

You may monitor the conditions in your garden in real time using an app on your phone or tablet. You can be notified if the moisture level falls too low or the temperature becomes too hot or cold. You can also create watering plans for your plants to ensure that they get the proper amount of water at the right time of day.

Overall, your smart garden system can save you time and energy while keeping your plants healthy and thriving. It can also provide you with piece of mind because you can watch and control your garden from anywhere at any time.

PASSWORD ACTIVATED ALARM SYSTEM


The alarm system project has various use cases and scenarios where it can be applied. One primary use case is residential security. The alarm system can be installed in homes to provide an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. Users can interact with the system using a keypad connected to the Nexys A7 FPGA, entering security codes to arm or disarm the system. When an intrusion is detected, the system activates the buzzer to generate a loud alarm, alerting occupants and deterring intruders.

Another use case is commercial security. The alarm system can be deployed in commercial buildings, offices, or retail stores to safeguard valuable assets and ensure the safety of employees and customers. Authorized personnel can interact with the system through the keypad, entering access codes to control the system's operation. In the event of a security breach, the system triggers the buzzer to emit a loud alarm, attracting attention and prompting immediate response from security personnel.
