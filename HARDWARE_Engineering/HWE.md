## PASSWORD-ACTIVATED ALARM SYSTEM


The alarm system project has various use cases and scenarios where it can be applied. One primary use case is residential security. The alarm system can be installed in homes to provide an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. Users can interact with the system using a keypad connected to the Nexys A7 FPGA, entering security codes to arm or disarm the system. When an intrusion is detected, the system activates the buzzer to generate a loud alarm, alerting occupants and deterring intruders.

Another use case is commercial security. The alarm system can be deployed in commercial buildings, offices, or retail stores to safeguard valuable assets and ensure the safety of employees and customers. Authorized personnel can interact with the system through the keypad, entering access codes to control the system's operation. In the event of a security breach, the system triggers the buzzer to emit a loud alarm, attracting attention and prompting an immediate response from security personnel.
